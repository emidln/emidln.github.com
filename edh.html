<h2>Broken EDH</h2>

<p>In general, this is a more ruthless and faster-paced version of EDH. Ante, conspiracy cards, the power8, and Time Vault are banned.</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Normal EDH / Commander Rules, excepting banlist and cardboard sanctioned.</li>
    <li>The banned list is listed below.</li>
    <li>Proxies are allowed, but players are encouraged to play genuine magic cards whenever possible. This is a casual format. We like to play games, and proxies are allowed insofar as the table allows them. If you are playing with a proxy, try to make it as close as possible so it is easily recognizable for the card it is.</li>
    <li>Games start at 30 life.</li>
    <li>Make speedy plays. Do not tank. You're not playing for anything, so don't waste our time. If you time out, your turn is over. Don't make the table get out the minute-glass and the Time Stop.</li>
</ul>
